# Introduction

This project provides a vision-based topological
SLAM algorithm for place recognition.
It represents a 3D environment by a
graph-based topological map, which comprises nodes
representing previously visited locations and edges representing
the connectivity of these locations. Place recognition is performed
by the efficient the bag-of-word
image matching approach. A geometric validation procedure is
performed afterwards to verify matched images and obtain finer
pose estimation.
